OVERVIEW-::::-
This project is a microcontroller-based application developed using Atmel Studio for programming the ATmega32 microcontroller.
The simulation of the project is created in Proteus, featuring an ATmega32, a button, a resistor, and a 16x2 alphanumeric LCD display.








FEATURES-::::-
Microcontroller: ATmega32
Components: Button, Resistor, 16x2 Alphanumeric LCD Display
Development Environment: Atmel Studio
Simulation: Proteus








PROJECT DESCRIPTION-::::-
This project demonstrates the integration of a button, a resistor, and a 16x2 alphanumeric LCD display with the ATmega32 microcontroller. 
The button is used as an input, and the microcontroller processes the input, controlling the display on the LCD.The Atmel Studio project contains the
source code written in C for the ATmega32 microcontroller. It showcases the handling of button presses, the utilization of a resistor, 
and the communication with the 16x2 LCD to display relevant information.The Proteus simulation allows users to visualize and validate the functionality 
of the project without the need for physical hardware. The virtual components interact as they would in a real-world scenario, providing a reliable
testing environment.
